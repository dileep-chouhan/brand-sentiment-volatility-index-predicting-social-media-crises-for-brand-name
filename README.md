# Brand Sentiment Volatility Index: Predicting Social Media Crises for [Brand Name]

## Overview

This project analyzes social media data to develop a predictive model for identifying periods of heightened negative sentiment towards [Brand Name].  The goal is to provide early warning signals of potential social media crises, allowing for proactive crisis management and effective reputation protection.  The analysis involves collecting social media data, performing sentiment analysis, and building a predictive model to forecast future sentiment volatility.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Numpy:** For numerical computations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning model building (specify specific models used here, e.g., `RandomForestClassifier`, `LSTM`).
* **Tweepy (or other relevant library):** For social media data acquisition (Specify the library used).


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *Note:* You may need to adjust file paths within `main.py` to match your local directory structure.  The script may also require configuration parameters, such as API keys for social media access.  Refer to the comments within `main.py` for more details.


## Example Output

The script will produce the following outputs:

* **Console Output:**  Printed analysis summarizing key findings, including descriptive statistics of sentiment scores, model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and predictions for future sentiment volatility.
* **Plot Files:**  Generated visualizations such as:
    * A time series plot showing the brand's sentiment over time (`sentiment_timeseries.png`).
    * A visualization of the predictive model's performance (e.g., a confusion matrix, ROC curve - specify the plots generated).
